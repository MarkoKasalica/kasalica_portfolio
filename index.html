          <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
          <p>
            For about 1.5 years I've been working with Front-End technologies.
            Most of my projects include: <span>JavaScript</span>,
            <span>ReactJS</span>, <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and
            <span>MaterialUI</span>. My goal is to master building and designing
            UI for all kinds of Web Applications. Recently, I also started using
            <span>NodeJS</span> and <span>ExpressJS</span> framework. I was also
            curious about what lies behind Front-End field and how those
            structures work. With my background in JavaScript, best choice for
            introduction to Back-End was mentioned NodeJS. Before the beginning
            of my Web Developement journey I've been studying Sociology on
            University of Belgrade, where I got Bachelor and Master's degree.
            Through those studies I found out important is Informational
            Technology for contemporary global society and all the positive
            effects it brings. Besides that, the experience on university helped
            me building strong working ethic and discipline.

              <h1>Movie App</h1>
              <p>
                A web application built in <span>ReactJS</span>. It has a search
                filter which communicates with The Movie Database API (TMDB).
                The app fetches data from the metioned API and displays name,
                image, IMDB rating and short description of the searched movie.

              <h1>Recipe App</h1>

              <p>
                This app works as a book of all kind of food recipes. With
                similar logic as the MovieApp, it is built in
                <span>ReactJS</span> and has implemented third-party API. This
                time I used Edamam API. On the first page we have a input form
                made for searching recipe. Results sent from Edamam database
                give us an image of searched food, a title, a recipe and a short
                description of main nutrients. On the main food card we also
                have a "See more" button which leads us to programmed modal with
                details about searched recipe and its nutrient value.

              <p>
                This project is a clear exception in comparison with all the
                others presented here. Main difference lies in fact that this
                project can't be percived as FrontEnd project. Built with
                <span>ExpressJS</span>, a framework made for simplifying usage
                of <span>NodeJS</span> - most popular BackEnd platform written
                in <span>JavaScript</span>. Here we have an exercise for
                studying and implementing basic BackEnd concepts and
                functionalities for the Web: creation of a server, defining
                routes, usage of middleware functions, usage of cookies,
                sessions, MongoDB database, hashing of a password and finally
                defining the register and login process for Authentication of
                users. We didn't use FrontEnd form so everything was tested with
                <span>Postman API</span> platform.

              <h1>Material UI Blog</h1>

              <p>
                In this project I used <span>Material UI</span>, one of the most
                popular libraries of <span>ReactJS</span> UI components that
                implements Google's Material Design. It made process of styling
                much easier and faster. The interface is built to look as a blog
                app with other functionalities, such as using your personal
                account and chating with other users(friends or connections).
                It's important to mention that this is just a design without any
                real functionalities, except for button made for changing the
                dark/light mode.

              <h1>ReactJS Expense Tracker</h1>

              <p>
                This is a simple <span>ReactJS</span> project for exercising
                basic concepts of working in React environment. Main feature
                feature here refers to impementation of input/output logic which
                implies usage of props, an object that is passed through React
                components. Process of manipulating the props (short for
                properties) here starts with gaining the value from user in our
                form to displaying the entered value (in this case expence) with
                details like date and price.
